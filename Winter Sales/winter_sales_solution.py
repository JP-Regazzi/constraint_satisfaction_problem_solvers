Description:
This code solves a logic puzzle involving students with various attributes
(name, shirt color, age, juice preference, discount received, and item bought)
placed in ordered positions. The constraints enforce unique attributes for each
student and relative conditions (e.g., "Rachel is 25 years old" or "The student
with a black T-shirt is to the right of Rachel").

To solve this, the code uses Python's constraint library to define the problem and
apply constraints for each attribute and their relations. It ensures each constraint
is met across all positions to find a unique solution that matches all specified conditions.
If a unique solution exists, it outputs the name of the student who bought the TV.


Usage:
To run this script, ensure Python is installed with the constraint module available.
Execute the script from the command line using:
python ./winter_sales_solution.py
